Within the upper floor of the Pyramid, lies a ritual chamber, blood lines the floor and
pedestal within. Whoever enters feels observed. 

If they go towards the Temple above, they'll see tatooed people coming out of it,
as well as shadar'kai elves giving out orders. They feel an immense amount of power emanating 
from within the Temple, and will need to roll DC 18 Charisma saving throws or become frightened.

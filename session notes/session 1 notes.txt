FINALLY!!

wohoooooooo!!

    A bird has started following the party from the skies, and they can tell it's tattooed in the same
way their enemies have been.
    The party arrive at night at a neighboring town, that marks the split between the roads to evaemon

Yggdrassil, where, with the help of a local mage, they manage to repel the pursuer using the Leylines
to their advantage, which they are told by the mage are progressively getting weaker lately. Alua, 
using detect maguic, manages to look at the leylines, with difficulty, and realizes
